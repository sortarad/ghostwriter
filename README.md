# Ghostwriter

## Static text is boring, let's get it moving.

One of my favorite thing about the web is motion. Gone are the days where everything had to be still. We now have animations, transitions and so much more. One of my favorite effects is the typewriter effect (powered by typed.js). It looks so cool.

The name of this add-on is based on one of my favorite shows as a kid, Ghostwriter. Whenever I see this typing effect I'm sure it's Ghostwriter who is responsible.
